          <h3>Founded in 2011</h3>

            Tree House Brewing Company began in a small red barn in Brimfield,
            Massachusetts. Since day one our goal has been to present you with
            reliably delightful beer that can contribute positively to lifeâ€™s
            precious moments, and serve them in a cheerful, communal
            environment. Having grown from a five-gallon Coleman cooler
            brewhouse to a state-of-the-art 60 BBL, German-engineered brewhouse,
            Tree House, an independent brewer-owned brewery, is driven by the
            same people with the same energy and the same intent to bring you
            joy as it was ten years ago.
